<!--     EzEnigma by Craig Swann
    This web page recreates the functionality of the Enigma ecryption machine that was invented for commercial use,
    but later used by the German military in World War 2.   The device used a constantly changing set of electrical circuit
    pathways to take letters A-Z and numbers 0-9 and encode them to an encrypted cypher text.  This constantly changing circuit
    allowed for much greater security than a simple substitution cypher.  To put this in the simplest terms, each successive use 
    of any letter would result in a difference cypher text of that letter. So entering "GGGGG" would result in something like "HWPBD"
    In order for the recipients of the encoded messages to translate them back to plain text, they had to have 2 things. The first was 
    their own Enigma machine, and the second thing was the configuration that the encoding machinhe used when the message was encrypted.
    An Enigma machine used ritating cylinders that had 26 positions they could start at. Typically the machine used any three of a set
    of five cyliners.  Because order matters we us P(n,r) to determine the number of permutations we can select and arrange 3 cylinders
    from a set of 5. This gives us 60 ways.  Each of the 60 ways has 26 possible positions so we take 60 to the power of 78 (26 letters
    x 3 cylinders) and arrive at 2.333034e+110 total ways that the Enigma machine can be configured.
           All of these possible ways for the machine to be configured were the result of choosing 3 cylinders from a set of 5 and then
    choosing the orientation of each of the cylinders in 36 ways. Each configuration changed a physical circuit pathway that resulted in 
    the lighting of a letter or number when a character was pressed on the machines keyboard. This lighed character was the cypher text
